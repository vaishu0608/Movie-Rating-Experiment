# project Description
A movie rating system where users are allowed to rate and comment on movies online. These ratings are provided as input to the website's admin. The admin then checks reviews and criticsâ€™ ratings and displays an online rating for every movie. The purpose of this project is to develop an online system that automatically allows users to post reviews and store them.
I Have Developed Using Azure Machine Learning Classic.
